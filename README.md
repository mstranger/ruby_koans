# Ruby Koans Solutions

My solutions to [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/).

_"The Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn Ruby. The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and some common functions and libraries. We also teach you culture. Testing is not just something we pay lip service to, but something we live. It is essential in your quest to learn and do great things in the language."_

### Run tests

In order to run the koans you need ruby and rake installed.

```bash
$ rake 
$ rake default
```

To run only a specific test run

```bash
$ ruby src/file_name.rb
```

Command 

```bash 
$ ruby src/path_to_enlightenment.rb
```

will run all tests.

### Run linter

You need to install `rubocop` before

```bash
$ rake lint
```

# Other stuff
